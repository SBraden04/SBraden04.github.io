This semester, This course really helped me understand the basics of web development. It made learning HTML and CSS much easier and gave me a good start. Going from my original mobile site to the new desktop version was a big change, there’s a big difference in how it looks and works now. The new site is much better, more polished, and lets me express my creativity better. Learning from FreeCodeCamp helped me fill in the gaps in my knowledge, making my designs more accurate and professional. It’s been a valuable experience, and I’m excited to keep learning and improving. In the end I am exited to learn new things and gain new skills in the field.
